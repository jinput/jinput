JInput is a cross-platform Java API designed for the discovery and polling of various input devices, encompassing
keyboards, mice, joysticks, and gamepads.

The supported range of devices is contingent on the underlying operating system. JInput utilizes
[DirectInput](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ee416842(v=vs.85)) on Windows,
`/dev/input/event*` [device nodes](https://wiki.debian.org/device_node) on Linux, and also has support for Mac OS X.

Introduced in 2003, JInput is part of a suite of open-source technologies ([JOGL](https://jogamp.org/jogl/www/),
[JOAL](https://jogamp.org/joal/www/), JInput) initiated by the Game Technology Group at Sun Microsystems. Its
development was led by members of the [JSR 134](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=134) expert group, focusing on Java
gaming.
