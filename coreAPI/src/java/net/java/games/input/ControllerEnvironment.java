/**
 * A ControllerEnvironment represents a collection of controllers that are
 * physically or logically linked.  By default, this corresponds to the
 * environment for the local machine.
 * <p>
 * In this reference implementation, this class can also be used to register
 * controllers with the default environment as "plug-ins".  A plug-in is
 * created by subclassing ControllerEnvironment with a class that has a public
 * no-argument constructor, implements the net.java.games.util.plugins.Plugin
 * interface and has a name ending in "Plugin".  
 * (See net.java.games.input.DirectInputEnvironmentPlugin in the DXplugin
 *  part of the source tree for an example.)
 *
 * When the DefaultControllerEnvrionment is instanced it uses the plugin library
 * to look for Plugins in both [java.home]/lib/controller and 
 * [user.dir]/controller.  This allows controller plugins to be installed either
 * globally for the entire Java environment or locally for just one particular
 * Java app.
 *
 * For more information on the organization of plugins within the controller
 * root directories, see net.java.games.util.plugins.Plugins (Note the
 * plural -- "Plugins" not "Plugin" which is just a marker interface.)
